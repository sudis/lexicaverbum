**`/crash [bet]`**
- Do you want to earn more money? Or lose more? You can win millions with "`crash`" which is a very risky type of gambling. The game begins by asking you to place a bet. When you place your first bet, you have two possibilities. You either win or lose. I know it looks the same as other games. 

- Nothing happens when you lose the first time. You will only **lose as much as your bet**.

- But if you're lucky and you win, you're in the **second round**. Here you are asked. `Continue` or `Stand`? If you choose to `Stand`, the amount shown on the right will be credited to your account. If you accept the **risk** and want to `Continue`, the game is played again and the result is **doubled** or you **lose** the game.

- While we were making almost **$400** the first time, our greed made us lose even more money. There are many types of multipliers in this game. Even when you win, you can lose. Because **X0** and **X1** are also present among the multipliers. What do these mean? An **X0**-type multiplier sets your bankroll to **$0**. Let's say you wanted to **continue**. Losing more is the moment. A multiplier of type **X1** protects the value of your money.

- Let's say your luck went great. You get a multiplier of type X3 in the first round and a multiplier of type X4 in the next round. (*Here a **$100 bet** is used.*) The math works like this: `FIRST ROUND MULTIPLER * YOUR BET + SECOND ROUND MULTIPLER * YOUR BET`.
